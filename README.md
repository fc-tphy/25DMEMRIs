The required virtual environment for the project should be compressed as split-volume archives in the env folder, with Python version 3.12.7 specified.

Run the source_evo_withoutDM.ipynb and source_evo_withDM.ipynb to get the initial parameters and sources to calculate the gravitational characteristic strains(hc_gwb40.ipynb and hc_gwb10.ipynb).

Run the emri_form_withoutDM.ipynb and emri_form_withDM.ipynb to get the picture of formation of EMRIs.

All data are stored as .csv file in data folder. Run result_form.ipynb, result_snr.ipynb and result.ipynb to draw figures.
